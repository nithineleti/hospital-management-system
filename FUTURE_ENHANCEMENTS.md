# Future Enhancements

This file lists practical improvements that can be implemented in upcoming phases.

## 1. Security Enhancements
- Add account lockout after repeated failed login attempts.
- Add password reset workflow with secure token expiration.
- Add optional 2FA (email OTP or authenticator app).
- Add audit trail for login/logout and critical data changes.
- Add security headers hardening and rate limiting for APIs.

## 2. Performance and Scalability
- Add pagination and filtering on all list screens and APIs.
- Introduce caching for dashboard and master data queries.
- Optimize expensive database queries with indexes.
- Add asynchronous processing for long-running jobs.
- Add load testing to identify throughput bottlenecks.

## 3. Database and Reliability
- Move from H2 (dev) to MySQL/PostgreSQL profile for production.
- Introduce migration tooling (Flyway or Liquibase).
- Add backup and restore procedures.
- Add soft delete and data archival strategy.
- Add optimistic locking for concurrent updates.

## 4. Functional Enhancements
- Add billing and payment module.
- Add nurse station workflow and triage management.
- Add operation theater scheduling.
- Add pharmacy stock expiry alerts and reorder automation.
- Add discharge summary generation (PDF).

## 5. API and Integration
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
- Add API versioning strategy (`/api/v1`).
- Add integration with lab systems and external EMR tools.
- Add email/SMS notifications for appointments and reminders.
- Add webhook support for external integrations.

## 6. Reporting and Analytics
- Add advanced KPI dashboard (occupancy, wait time, revenue trends).
- Add downloadable reports (CSV/PDF).
- Add doctor productivity and patient outcome reports.
- Add monthly inventory variance reports.

## 7. DevOps and Quality
- Add CI pipeline for build, tests, and security scans.
- Add automated dependency vulnerability checks in CI.
- Increase test coverage (unit, integration, API tests).
- Add static code analysis and quality gates.
- Add containerization (Docker) and environment-specific deployment docs.

## 8. UI/UX Improvements
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard flow, color contrast).
- Add global search across patients, doctors, prescriptions.
- Add advanced table interactions (sort, export, inline actions).
- Add notification center for pending tasks and alerts.

## Suggested Implementation Order
1. Security + CI vulnerability checks.
2. Database migration strategy + production profile.
3. Performance optimization + pagination.
4. Reporting and workflow enhancements.
5. Integrations and automation.
